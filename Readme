Steps to compile for the first run are as follows:

1.	python Aggregate_reuters.py --> specify the path to reuters data in reuters_path variable

2.	python tok_lem.py

3.	python db_stats.py

4.	python vector.py

5.	python query_vectorizer.py

or 

1. python Aggregate_reuters.py

2. python update.py

NOTE: The corpus is dynamic. New documents should be appended to the docs.csv file, followed by execution of the update.py script to update the changes. 

Since method used for the representation of the corpus is not known, it has to be converted to universal format. Universal format for storing a corpus is a csv file(docs.csv). Corresponding corpus should be converted into csv format for testing the code. The corpus should be stored with filename docs.csv
The csv file's first three columns can store any metadata about the documents. And the fourth column contains the document content.
